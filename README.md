# Fight-to-death
The game about 2 warriors fighting to the death.

25.06.2019 - The game currently has 2 weapons(like classes):
"Sword & shield" and "Daggers".
Each of them have unique behavior in fight.
Both player and enemy can use both of weapons.
In next updates I'm planning to add more enemies and merchant with stuff between fights,
so the gold cost will be added to item class and enemies will drop gold or maybe items(maybe both).
Need to do some basic game logic - transition between fight and merchant store and to the
next fight with NEW enemy. After player's death there should be a game over screen with "Score" -
enemies killed.

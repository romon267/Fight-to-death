# Fight-to-death
The game about 2 warriors fighting to the death.

27.06.2019 The game is done. Known bugs: color changing of text - dont know how to fix;
                                         potions overheal - now it's a feature, no armor, only raw health power.

The game has 2 races: elves(lower health, higher damage) and dwarves(higher health and block, lower damage).
2 weapons: Shield(yes) - can block(wow), block chance and raise shield option. And Daggers - higher damage and crit chance and overall accuracy, can sharp weapons to get a guaranteed crit on next attack. Crits can pierce block.
After the fight you enter the store and can buy weapons, armor(no), potions, and cheap healing(try it).
After the shop game starts the next fight with stronger opponent, and again and again till player dies.
After it, it displays the game over screen and your score(enemies killed).
This is an OOP learning project and my first ever project overall. Good luck to anyone who may possibly play it!
